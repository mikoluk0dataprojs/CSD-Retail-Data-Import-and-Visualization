# CSD-Retail-Data-Import-and-Visualization

## Full project in CSD_retail_study.ipynb 

Data Visualization of Census and Statistis Dept (CSD) Retail Sales data on selected category
- CSD releases retail sales data and CPI data in monthly basis
- For some product categories, supermarket and department stores are significant retail channels
- However, CSD only provides product-categorial retail sales value breakdown but not volume breakdown in these channels
- Theoretically, retail volume could be approximated by offsetting CPI from retail sales if corresponding CPI component is available
- In this project we take category 'Alcoholic drinks and tobacco' as an example to approximate its overall retail volume trend
